# Tygo van den Hurk (School)
Howdy there! I'm Tygo, and this is the place that I put all my school related repositories. To keep business and pleasure separated. Take a look at any of them! Some (or most) might be private. This is because [TU/e](https://tue.nl) makes you sign a contract that the code you write, the products you make are theirs, and theirs alone. So for legal reasons, they might be private.

## Word of Warning
These repositories is to show off the work my teammates and I have done.  As a student copying any of this is fraud, and I don't recomment that. Doing that could get you kicked out of university, they take that seriously.
