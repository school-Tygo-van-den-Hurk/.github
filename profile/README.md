# Tygo van den Hurk (School)
Howdy there! I'm Tygo, and this is the place that I put all my school related repositories. To keep business and pleasure separated. Take a look at any of them! Some (or most) might be private. This is because [TU/e](https://tue.nl) makes you sign a contract that the code you write, the products you make are theirs, and theirs alone. So for legal reasons, they might be private.

> [!CAUTION]
> As a student copying any of this is legally fraud. Doing so, could get you kicked out of university. I highly recommend against it.
